# Los-Angeles-Arrest-Data-Analysis
## Project Overview

This project explores arrest incident data from the City of Los Angeles, providing insights into crime patterns, demographic distributions, and geographical trends. The analysis covers various aspects of law enforcement data to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships.

## Analysis Components

### Crime Statistics & Demographics
- **Annual Arrest Trends**: Analysis of booking patterns across different years
- **Area-Based Crime Distribution**: Identification of high-arrest density regions
- **Age Demographics**: Statistical analysis of age distributions across crime categories
- **Charge Group Patterns**: Examination of crime type frequencies and distributions

### Geographical Analysis
- **Spatial Distribution**: Arrest density around key landmarks and locations
- **Distance-Based Analysis**: Incidents within specific radii of geographical points
- **Street-Level Crime Mapping**: Arrest frequency along major thoroughfares
- **Geospatial Patterns**: Regional variations in arrest types and frequencies

### Statistical Insights
- **Significance Testing**: Statistical validation of demographic differences across crime categories
- **Probability Analysis**: Identification of disproportionate crime rates across neighborhoods
- **Trend Analysis**: Temporal patterns in arrest data and predictive modeling
- **Outlier Detection**: Statistical methods for identifying anomalous patterns
## Technical Methodology

### Data Processing Pipeline
- Temporal filtering and date-based segmentation
- Geographical coordinate parsing and validation
- Missing data handling and quality assurance
- Statistical sampling and group analysis

### Analytical Techniques
- **Geospatial Calculations**: Distance computations using spherical Earth projection models with 6371km Earth radius
- **Statistical Testing**: Z-score analysis, confidence interval testing, and significance validation
